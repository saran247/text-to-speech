**Features:**

**Text Input:** The main interface features a large text area where users can type or paste the text they wish to be converted into speech.

**Convert to Speech Button:** Once the text is entered, users can click the "Convert to Speech" button to initiate the text-to-speech conversion. This button is prominently displayed and styled to stand out with a striking black background and white text that changes to red when hovered over.

**Responsive Design:** The application is styled with a modern and clean design, using a visually appealing background with floating geometric shapes for a dynamic look. The central container is flexibly positioned to ensure the text area and button are easily accessible and centered on the page.

**Customizable Speech Settings:** The speech rate, volume, and pitch of the spoken text are adjustable. In the current setup, the speech rate is set to a standard level, volume to the maximum, and pitch to a normal value, ensuring clear and audible output.

**Styling and Animation:**

**Background:** The background is a vibrant and textured SVG pattern that adds depth and visual interest without overwhelming the content.

Text and Button Styling: The text area and button have distinct styling. The text area features a shadow effect, providing a three-dimensional feel, while the button is designed with rounded corners and a bold font to enhance user interaction. Hover effects on the button add a touch of interactivity, changing the color to red and the text to white.

**JavaScript Functionality:**

**Speech Synthesis:** The convertToSpeech() function leverages the Web Speech API to convert the text input into speech. This function retrieves the value from the text area and uses the SpeechSynthesisUtterance object to manage the speech output, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.

This application is ideal for accessibility purposes, language learning, or simply for experimenting with text-to-speech technology. Enjoy the ease of converting text into speech with just a few clicks!
